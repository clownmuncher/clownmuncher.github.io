<p><strong>As</strong> poorly theorized on social media “ you can tell time by looking at a cats eye and depending on the dialation size, you can tell what time it”.
<p>This is merely the foundation to the time travel theory of cat eyes.</p>

<p>Let us first dive in the time telling via cat eye discours. With this diagram placed somewhere here you can see that it is believed that depeding on how wide or small the cats eye is dialated, the time could be told. Now there are obvious plotholes into this thoery such as outside factors that can naturally or un-naturally change the dialation level of a cats eye. If the cat sees a critter that it wishes to kill and consume, the cats eye will naturally widen or if it hears or sees something that it doesnt like then the eyes will naturally shrink. That pokes some holes into the thoery of course but the theory had to come from somewhere, and like many newly emerged ideas, there will be mistakes that makes the idea obsolite. If we can correctly apply the use of the time idea and find the correct way to apply it, we can gainn the ability to timem travel.</p>
